        <h2 class="title">JAVASCRIPT INTRO - ARRAYS</h2>
        <article class="paragraph">JavaScript is a scripting language which runs in the browser. It provides interactivity to the web page. In the past. JavaScript were running only in web browsers but now they are embedded in servers with the help of Node.js. It should be minded that Java and JavaScript are two different things although their names have "Java" in common.</article>
        <article class="paragraph">There are some points that we need to be careful when we write JavaScript. First, JavaScript is case sensitive. It means "name" and "Name" are two different elements. Second, we use camelCase, if we have combined words. Third, semicolons should be used after every action we make. It is not obligatory but it is highly recommended.</article>
        <article class="paragraph">Arrays are variables which contain many values at the same time. In other words, they work as lists. We can add arrays within arrays. Each element inside the array has index number. Index numbers start with 0 not with 1 so if we want to target second element, we should use index 1. Here are some examples of JavaScript Arrays:</article>
        <pre>
          <code class="language-js">
            let arr1  = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 
            console.log(arr1);
            let arr2  = ["Jane", "John", "James"]; 
            console.log(arr2);
            <br>
            //Add an element to an array.
            arr2.push("Rebecca"); 
            console.log(arr2); //adds an element at the end of the array.
            console.log( arr2.length ); // .length shows how many items we have inside the array.
            <br>
            //Delete an element from an array
            arr2.pop(); 
            console.log(arr2); // It removes the "last" element of the array.
            arr2.shift(); 
            console.log(arr2); // It removes the "first" element of the array.
            arr2.splice(1, 2); 
            console.log(arr2); /** It removes a custom element. First number is "index", 
            second one is "how many elements we want to remove".**/
            <br>
            //Change a value inside an array
            arr2[0] = "Ashley"; 
            console.log(arr2);
            <br>
            //Changing elements of array with .splice
            arr2.splice(2, 0, "Sasha");
            console.log( arr2 );
