        <article class="paragraph">Hi! I am Seda Sakarya. Former English teacher who is passionate about IT and IT related areas.</article>
        <article class="paragraph"> I studied English Language and Literature and I was an English teacher. I realized that my interest lies somewhere else and I took a different tack. IT is an ongoing journey for me and I enjoy every part of it.</article>
        <article class="paragraph">I did not have chance to go to the university to learn coding but It was not the end of the world. I found a lot of online courses and tutorials which were very useful in my IT journey. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and I am still learning other programming languages. If you love lifelong learning, you are at the right place. </article>
        <article class="paragraph">My goal is to work in IT, to gain experiences and to be an expert in a specific area of IT.</article>
